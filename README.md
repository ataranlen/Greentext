#Greentext
##Permission based Greentext.

A MineTexas Spigot Plugin

My players requested it, I had to write it. You can give permission to hide the username from the greentext as well.

###Permissions:
```greentext.use - Allows use of /me for greentext
greentext.anon - Hides the player's name from the greentext```

###Usage:
* /me [Memes to greentext] - Sends a greentext.

Result: `> Memes to greentext` or without greentext.anon permission `ataranlen > Memes to greentext`
